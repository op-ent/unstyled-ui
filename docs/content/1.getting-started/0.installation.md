# Installation

::alert{type="warning"}
Unstyled UI is under active development and is not yet ready for production use. Breaking changes may occur at any time.
::

To use Unstyled UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

::code-group
  ```pnpm [PNPM]
  yarn add @op-ent/unstyled-ui
  ```
  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn add @op-ent/unstyled-ui
  ```
  ```bash [NPM]
  npm install @op-ent/unstyled-ui
  ```
::

After installing Unstyled UI, you need to set up the ConfigProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ConfigProvider` component
import { ConfigProvider } from '@op-ent/unstyled-ui'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ConfigProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ConfigProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </ConfigProvider>
  )
}
```
